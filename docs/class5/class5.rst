F5 Distributed Cloud 301 - Introduction to Managed Kubernetes
=============================================================

F5 Distributed Cloud App Stack is a SaaS-based offering to deploy, secure, and operate a fleet of applications across the distributed infrastructure in multi-cloud or edge environments. It can scale to a large number of clusters and locations with centralized orchestration, observability, and operations to reduce the complexity of managing a fleet of distributed clusters.

This Lab environment highlights some of the basic concepts of F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) AppStack.

During the lab you will be emulating a customer that needs to deploy applications closer to the user. The goal is to understand the steps and requirements to place workloads in the F5 Distributed Cloud virtual Kubernetes implementation.
