Lab 1- Working with Managed K8s (Optional)
------------------------------------------

In this lab, we will learn the following:

â€¢  How to view and work with Managed K8s in the Console and global kubeconfig file to access and deploy publish a web server across the ADN to the Internet.

#. Locate your downloaded kubeconfig file, and follow the Kubernetes documentation to configure your local kubectl tool. 

    `Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/>`_

#. Once you have configured your local kubectl tool, you should be able to manage for your managed k8s site using kubectl commands.

**Exercise 2 - Viewing the K8s Cluster in UI and CLI**

#. In XC Console Click on the Managed K8s Site you are working in, and view the following in the UI Dashboard, Nodes, Namespaces, Deployments, Services, and Pods
